For now, contributing will be extreamly hard as the code changes too frequently.

However that should not stop you from trying. I am open to suggestions.

In the near future, theme development will be gladly excepted.

Feel free to notice critical bugs and report them at any time.

Other than that, just comment on things you would love to see in the project.
