## Below you will find some ways to help!
### If what you seek is not here, just ask!

### Issues
#### Found a bug? add it to the issues!
We will do our best to fix the problem as fast as possible.
#### If you have an idea for Mamba, add an issue with "IDEA: " at the beginning of the title.
We will discuss with and/or without you about your idea and how we might implement it.
If we like the idea we will add it to the ideas list in the Projects tab.
Once we know what release the idea will be in, it will be moved into the release project.
You may also feel free to fork Mamba and submit a pull request.

### Contributing to code
#### Structure
It is important to stay consistent with our structure (or at least our belief in structure). We want our code laid out in an extremely easy to use and understand fashion.
#### Pep8
Do your best to make your code Pep8 compliant. We may ask for changes to be made before a pull request is accepted.
#### Testing
It's best to add test cases for your code, although this is not exactly required.
